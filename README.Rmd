The goal of `patchwork` is to make it ridiculously simple to combine separate
ggplots into the same graphic. As such it tries to solve the same problem as
`gridExtra::grid.arrange()` and `cowplot::plot_grid` but using an API that 
incites exploration and iteration, and scales to arbitrarily complex layouts.

## Installation

You can install patchwork from CRAN using `install.packages('patchwork')`. 
Alternatively you can grab the development version from github using devtools:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("thomasp85/patchwork")
```

## Basic example

The usage of `patchwork` is simple: just add plots together!

```{r example}
library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)

p1 <- ggplot(mtcars) + geom_point(aes(mpg, disp))
p2 <- ggplot(mtcars) + geom_boxplot(aes(gear, disp, group = gear))

p1 + p2
```

patchwork provides rich support for arbitrarily complex layouts with full 
alignment. As an example, check out this very readable code for nesting three 
plots on top of a third:

```{r, message=FALSE}
p3 <- ggplot(mtcars) + geom_smooth(aes(disp, qsec))
p4 <- ggplot(mtcars) + geom_bar(aes(carb))

(p1 | p2 | p3) /
      p4
```
