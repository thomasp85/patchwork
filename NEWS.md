# patchwork (development version)

* Axes and axis titles can now be collected using the `plot_layout()` function.
  Collecting axes will remove duplicated axes in the x- or y-direction. 
  Collecting axis titles will also remove duplicated titles in the x- or 
  y-direction, but also merge duplicated titles in the other direction (#150).

# patchwork 1.1.3

* `NULL` can now be used with the different arithmetic operators and will result
  in a non-operation (i.e. the non-null part will be returned unmodified) (#290)
* Fix a bug that prevented plots with multi-level strips from being merged 
  together (#277)
* Patchworks will now render correctly when unserialised in a fresh session, 
  providing the patchwork package is available (#242)
* Fixed a bug preventing faceted plots with strip placement outside the axis 
  from being aligned (#325)
* Fixed a bug that let to inconsistent results when combining fixed aspect plots
  in different order (#274)
* Fixed a bug that prevented nested patchworks with empty columns or rows at the 
  bottom or to the right to be inserted into a layout (#273)
* Patchwork objects now behaves more correctly like an unnamed list of ggplots. 
  This makes `View()` work on them (#317), and allow one to use `length()` to
  determine the number of patches in a patchwork (#293)
* Expressions and calls can now be used as plot annotations in the same way as
  they can be used for titles in ggplot2 (#295)

# patchwork 1.1.2

* Better error message if rendering fails due to too small plotting space

# patchwork 1.1.1

* Use vdiffr conditionally to pass test on M1 mac
* Add `str()` method to patchwork objects (#217)
* Fix a bug in `inset_element()` when insetting plots with fixed dimensions 
  (#214)
* Make sure that `-`, `/`, and `|` works with all supported object types (#221)

# patchwork 1.1.0

* Add `inset_element()` to allow adding plots as insets
* patchwork now supports `raster` and `nativeRaster` objects
* Avoid incrementing tag counter when recursing into a nested plot without 
  additional tags to use (#147)
* Fix bug that prevented strips turned off with `element_blank()` from working 
  (#200)
* Add option to supply a custom sequence of tags to use for auto-tagging (#211, 
  #63)

# patchwork 1.0.1

* Renaming of `align_plots()` to `align_patches()` to avoid namespace clash
  with cowplot (#130)
* Renaming of `as_grob()` (unexported) to `as_patch()` to avoid potential 
  future namespace clash with cowplot (#131)
* Fix bug in plot simplification with `theme(strip.placement = 'outside')` 
  (#132)
* Fix a bug in guide collection in R >= 4.0 due to the new unit implementation
  in grid (#170)
* Collected guides now behave as ggplot2 guides when position is top or bottom
  (#137)
* Fix a bug in base graphic support where the environment of the plot was not
  captured (#138)
* Fix a bug when combining plots having guides placed manually in combination 
  with faceting (#144)
* Fix a bug where having negative margins around the legend would result in an
  unintelligeble error (#148)
* Fix a bug when trying to combine faceted plots with fixed aspect ratio (#156)
* Fix alignments of strips when only a single strip is present (#163)
* Fix a bug that caused theme void to result in errors (#180)
* Make aligning multiple fixed aspect plots more consistent (#175)
* Correct alignment of guides when ssembling fixed aspect plots (#140, 
  @ilia-kats)

# patchwork 1.0.0

* First CRAN release. Provide utility and operators for assembling and nesting
  plots into a composition, tag subplots, collect guides and remove duplicates,
  and align plots across pages.
