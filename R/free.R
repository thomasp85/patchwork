#' Free a plot from various alignments
#'
#' While the purpose of patchwork is often to align plots by their various parts,
#' sometimes this doesn't cut it and we want to compose plots without alignment.
#' The `free()` function tells patchwork to treat the content (which can either
#' be a ggplot or a patchwork) specially and not align it with the remaining
#' plots in the composition. `free()` has various modes to control what type of
#' "non-alignment" is applied (see Details). Further you can control which side
#' of the plot the non-alignment is applied to. You can stack `free()` calls if
#' you e.g. want the top part to not align to the panel and the left part to not
#' align to the labels.
#'
#' @param x A ggplot or patchwork object
#' @param type Which type of freeing should be applied. See the Details section
#' @param side Which side should the freeing be applied to. A string containing
#' one or more of "t", "r", "b", and "l"
#'
#' @return A modified version of `x` with a `free_plot` class
#'
#' @details
#' `free()` has multiple modes depending on what you are needing:
#'
#' The default `"panel"` will allow the panel area to ignore alginment with the
#' remaining plots and expand as much as needed to fill any empty space.
#'
#' The `"label"` type will instead free the axis label to keep its proximity to
#' the axis, even if a longer axis text from another plot would push them apart.
#'
#' The `"space"` type also keeps axis and title together, but will instead not
#' reserve any space for it. This allows the axis to occupy space in an
#' otherwise empty area without making additional space available for itself.

#' @examples
#' # Sometimes you have a plot that defies good composition alginment, e.g. due
#' # to long axis labels
#' library(ggplot2)
#' p1 <- ggplot(mtcars) +
#'   geom_bar(aes(y = factor(gear), fill = factor(gear))) +
#'   scale_y_discrete(
#'     "",
#'     labels = c("3 gears are often enough",
#'                "But, you know, 4 is a nice number",
#'                "I would def go with 5 gears in a modern car")
#'   )
#'
#' # When combined with other plots it ends up looking bad
#' p2 <- ggplot(mtcars) + geom_point(aes(mpg, disp))
#'
#' p1 / p2
#'
#' # We can fix this be using free (here, with the default "panel" type)
#' free(p1) / p2
#'
#' # If we still want the panels to be aligned to the right, we can choose to
#' # free only the left side
#' free(p1, side = "l") / p2
#'
#' # We can still collect guides like before
#' free(p1) / p2 + plot_layout(guides = "collect")
#'
#' # We could use "label" to fix the layout in a different way
#' p1 / free(p2, "label")
#'
#' # Another issue is that long labels are not using already available free
#' # space.
#' plot_spacer() + p1 + p2 + p2
#'
#' # This can be fixed with the "space" type
#' plot_spacer() + free(p1, "space", "l") + p2 + p2
