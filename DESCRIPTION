Description: The 'ggplot2' package provides a strong API for sequentially 
    building up a plot, but does not concern itself with composition of multiple
    plots. 'patchwork' is a package that expands the API to allow for 
    arbitrarily complex composition of plots by providing mathmatical operators
    for combining multiple plots. Other packages that addresses this need (but
    with a different approach) are 'gridExtra' and 'cowplot'.
