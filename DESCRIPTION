Description: The 'ggplot2' package provides a strong API for sequentially
    building up a plot, but does not concern itself with composition of
    multiple plots. 'patchwork' is a package that expands the API to allow
    for arbitrarily complex composition of plots by, among others,
    providing mathematical operators for combining multiple plots. Other
    packages that try to address this need (but with a different approach)
    are 'gridExtra' and 'cowplot'.
