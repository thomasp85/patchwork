- title: Plot Composition
  desc: >
    At the heart of patchwork lies a range of powerful functions for combining
    plots into an assembly of plots that can be layed out in a grid. Patchwork
    provides both an extension of ggplot2's `+` based API, along with a
    functinal interface.

- title: Layout Specifications
  desc: >
    While patchwork will automatically lay out the plots in a grid, additional
    control is often needed, along with the possibility of adding annotations
    etc.

- title: Alternative plot objects
  desc: >
    patchwork is build to work with ggplot2 but standard grobs can also be
    included. Further, it is possible to define empty areas if needed.

- title: Align across pages
  desc: >
    Sometimes it is necessary to align plots across pages, not within a
    composition, e.g. when creating figures for presentations. While not the
    main focus of patchwork, it still contains the necessary infrastructure to
    achieve this.
